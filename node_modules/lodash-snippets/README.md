# Lodash Snippets
Visual Studio Code snippets for lodash functions.

## About
This package runs the jsdoc command line tool against lodash and then transforms the JSON output into snippets.

It also doubles up as a demo for functional programming with lodash using ECMAScript 2015.

## Installation 
This snippet can be installed in VS Code using `ext install lodash-snippets`. You can also view the extension on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tomphilbin.lodash-snippets).
